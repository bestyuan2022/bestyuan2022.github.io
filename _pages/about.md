I am a first-year Economics PhD Student at MIT and an NSF Graduate Research Fellow. My interests are in labor and behavioral economics. I graduated from Brown University with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics-Economics in 2020. After graduation, I worked at Morgan Stanley and then as a Predoctoral Fellow at Harvard Business School.
